# Computer Vision

To broaden my understanding of computer vision (theoretically and practically), I will perform some key computer vision implementations.

## Topics

* Computer vision preprocessing: openCV
* Computer vision related DL techniques
* CNN applications: YOLO
* Computer vision DL applications: face recognitions
* Project
