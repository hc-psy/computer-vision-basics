# Computer Vision

To broaden my understanding of computer vision (theoretically and practically), I performed some basic but key computer vision implementations.

## Topics

* Computer vision preprocessing: openCV
* Computer vision related DL techniques
* CNN and cv-related framework: YOLO
* Applications of Computer vision with DL: face recognition
* Project
