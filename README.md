# Computer Vision

To broaden my understanding of computer vision (CV) theoretically and practically, I performed some basic but key computer vision implementations.

## Topics

* CV preprocessing: openCV
* CV and its deep learning models
* CNN and cv-related framework: YOLO
* Applications of Computer vision with DL: face recognition
* Project
